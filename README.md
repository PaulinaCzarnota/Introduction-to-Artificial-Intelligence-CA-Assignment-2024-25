This repository contains my final CA Assignment from the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence module, completed during my third year of Computer Science studies at TU Dublin.

# Assignment Overview  

The assignment was implemented using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook**, applying core machine learning techniques such as **feedforward propagation**, **backpropagation**, and **gradient descent**. The focus was on designing, training, and evaluating **Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs)** for various classification tasks. The models' performance was visualized and validated using metrics such as loss plots, accuracy scores, and predictions.  

# Classification Tasks  

1. **XOR Problem**: A binary classification challenge testing the ability to learn non-linear relationships.  
2. **Iris Dataset Classification**: Multi-class classification to identify iris flower species based on sepal and petal dimensions.  
3. **Transportation Mode Prediction**: Predicting modes of transport (bus, car, or train) based on demographic and economic data.  
4. **Seeds Dataset Classification**: Categorizing seeds into three types using morphological attributes.  

# Key Features  

- **Customizable Model**: Flexible architecture with variable input, hidden, and output layers.  
- **Data Integration**: Support for both manual data declaration and CSV file integration using Pandas.  
- **Loss Functions**: Implementation of **Mean Squared Error** and **Cross-Entropy** loss functions for performance evaluation.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimentation with learning rates, number of hidden neurons, and training epochs for optimization.  
- **Prediction Capability**: A `predict(x)` function to classify new inputs after training.  

# Learning Outcomes  

- **Model Development**: Gained hands-on experience in designing and optimizing neural networks.  
- **Performance Tuning**: Experimented with loss functions, learning rates, and hidden neurons.  
- **Practical Application**: Validated MLP performance in solving real-world classification tasks effectively.
